((TODO (WK): I suspect that there is already a list of connection types that we can just reference. In addition, I suspect we should just list connection attributes, such as latency, bandwidth, \"cost\", jitter, etc. Otherwise, we are going to have to keep updating this document every time someone invents a new connection type.))\n\nLeveraging what I learned in developing a spec for machine-readable broadband labels and in publishing broadband maps, etc. the following may be better:\n1. Access Network Connection Type\nIndicates the access network technology used.\nThis field MUST be in the file and MUST be populated.\nField: connection_type\nType/Format: string\nExamples: fixed, mobile, satellite\n\n2. Network Technology Type.\nThis indicates the access network technology used for a given BIAS offering. This is a numeric field using\nFCC-defined technology codes, limited to no more than 3 digits length. (In the future, it may be better to\nregister these codes with IANA and to maintain them globally, rather than on a regulator-specific basis.)\n\u2022 If a Fixed plan type, refer to the FCC\u2019s Fixed Technology Codes [42]. For example, hybrid-fiber coaxial\n(HFC) is \u201c40\u201d and fiber to the premises (FTTP) is \u201c50\u201d.\n\u2022 If a Mobile plan type, refer to the FCC\u2019s Mobile Technology Codes [43]. For example, 3G is \u201c300\u201d and\n5G is \u201c500\u201d. This field MUST be in the file and MUST be populated.\nNote that mobile networks (and possibly other network types) may support the newest technology type, such\nas 5G, while also remaining backward compatible with 4G and 3G. In such cases, the newest technology type\nshould be listed, because that is the current version/type of network.\nThis field MUST be in the file and MUST be populated.\nName: network_technology_type\nType/Format: numeric, range (0, 999)\nExamples: 40, 50, 500\n\n[42] \u201cFixed Technology Codes,\u201d Federal Communications Commission (FCC), May 2023 [Online].

For obvious reasons, this only covers [[RFC8805 - \"A Format for Self-Published IP Geolocation Feeds\"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8805/)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8805/) format, but the same solution works for whatever format (potentially with a new tag).\n\nThe way that this works is an address holder publishes their feed location in the RIR (using the \"geofeed:\" RPSL attribute, or the older \"remarks   Geofeed:\" if they havent updated yet).\n\nConsumers ingest this data by downloading the RIR DB, running 'whois' for the address, or they can download all validated feeds at once from https://geolocatemuch.com/geofeeds/validated-all.csv.\n\nExample using whois (for the IETF meeting network):\n```\n$ whois 31.130.224.1 | grep -i geo\nremarks:        Geofeed https://noc.ietf.org/geo/google.csv\n```\n\nOr, using e.g RIPE's data (running `whois` for each prefix doesn't scale):\n```\n$ rg -A 18 'inetnum:        31.130.224.0'  ripe.db    \n\ninetnum:        31.130.224.0 - 31.130.239.255\nnetname:        ietf-meeting-network\ndescr:          IETF Meeting Network\ncountry:        CH\norg:            ORG-IS136-RIPE\nadmin-c:        DUMY-RIPE\ntech-c:         DUMY-RIPE\nstatus:         ASSIGNED PI\nmnt-by:         RIPE-NCC-END-MNT\nmnt-by:         IETF-MNT\nmnt-by:         netnod-mnt\nmnt-routes:     ietf-mnt\nmnt-domains:    ietf-mnt\nnotify:         ripedb-updates@noc.ietf.org\ncreated:        2011-05-10T10:10:10Z\nlast-modified:  2021-08-31T18:46:35Z\nsource:         RIPE\nremarks:        Geofeed https://noc.ietf.org/geo/google.csv\nsponsoring-org: ORG-NIE1-RIPE\n```\n\nFor a sense of scale, the RIPE database has ~44,000 geo-located prefixes:\n```\nrg --no-line-number -i geofeed ripe.db | wc -l  \n   44107\n``` \nand ~3,000 unique.\n\nThis is because many geofeed files contain multiple prefixes. For example, Hostinger publishes https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hostinger/geofeed/main/geofeed.csv , which contains ~800 prefixes. This is much of the reason for having an array in the JSON format.\n\n\nMost CDNs / providers already ingest the RIR data for building routing policy, parsing AS-SETs, etc.\nIf they don't want to though, Massimo publishes a validated feeds at all of the data on https://geolocatemuch.com/\n\n",
